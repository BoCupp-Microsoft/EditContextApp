# EditContextApp

EditContext App aims to polyfill the gaps that EditContext API has caused as a result of exposing a low-level typing support to web developers. The API provides a better integration with [advanced text input methods](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/master/EditContext/explainer.md#example-text-input-methods) that native browser edit controls provide today. You can learn what the EditContextAPI is [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/master/EditContext/explainer.md).
